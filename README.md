Welcome to my personal website 👋  
A central space where I share my work in cybersecurity, academic research, and personal projects.

## 🧠 About Me

MSc graduate in Network and Information Security, based in London.  
My background includes hands-on experience in:

- VPN protocol testing using Kali Linux and AWS
- Vulnerability analysis and mobile app security
- Risk assessment, reporting, and data-driven visualizations using PowerBI
- Publication work in AI and security (ICDLAIR, University of Salerno)

I'm always exploring ways to blend technical skills with real-world problem-solving—whether through personal projects, collaborative research, or industry-focused work.
