Varun Godambe - IT & Security Analyst Portfolio
This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, designed to showcase my skills, projects, and professional experience as an IT and Security Analyst.

About This Project
This portfolio was built from the ground up to be a dynamic, modern, and fully responsive single-page application. It serves as a central hub for my professional profile, detailing my academic background from Kingston University London and Mumbai University, my hands-on project experience with technologies like VPNs and Cisco networking, and my core competencies in the cybersecurity domain.

The design philosophy was to create a "classy" and professional "futuristic coder" aesthetic that is clean, accessible, and engaging for visitors on any device.
